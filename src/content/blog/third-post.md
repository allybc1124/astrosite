New York:
One of my favorite places to visit is New York. I agree with many locals how despite how popular Times Square is, its not the first place tourists should go. The city is big and there are several different areas where you can have a better experience.

China:
China is one of the most beautiful places I been to! You can easily go from one city to another and be in a totally different area. If you go, make sure you visit Chengdu and see the pandas!


Japan:
This is a destination I think everyone should go visit at least. From the cherry blossoms to the ancient temples, theres so much to do explore!
